JAVASCRIPT PASSWORD GENERATOR CHALLENGE
##
I was provided with starter code to develop into a passwords generator. My first task is to figure out how to complete the code in order to reach the acceptance criteria.
 

Firstly, I need to determine how the code provided to me functions. So far I can see that there is a box for inputting user information and a red button to submit that information. However, the button currently does not respond when a user clicks it.
 

I need to add an eventListener in order to make the button work properly
 

The application does not currently generate a password due to their being no prompts for the user to choose from. I will have to modify the code so that the user is prompted to choose the criteria for their password
 

When deciding how to get this code to execute properly I wanted to pass all the data within the given arrays through a 'For Loop' that would then prompt the user to choose their password criteria. However this won't work because the user first needs to be prompted in order to input any criteria. I need to add a prompt function in order for the array data to populate for user.
 

Adding an event listener to the button is proving to be difficult as I cannot successfully run the method for this issue. Whenever I add 'onclick' to my button function it does not read as a proper JavaScript event.
 

When I rearranged how my function was written I was no longer receiving any error messages in the console but my button still does not seem to be responding to the event assigned to it. It could also be that my code for the password input values is incomplete and is therefore not being read so the button will also not be functional.
 

Placed code inside of button function while using if/else statements to prompt user on password criteria.
 

Used For Loop function in order to pass values through array and print the password to the console.
 

BIGGEST CHALLENGES
##
My biggest challenges were trying to figure how to research information and being able to use that information to write functioning code. I was understanding how the code should work but was unable to write it out. Once I had figured out which tools I needed to be using I was still missing key components to the functions themselves. I worked with my tutor to go over the gaps in my knowledge and break down the parts that were incomplete and that I did not fully understand. After doing this I was able to write functioning for my password generator.
